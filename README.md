## Problem Description
We are currently facing a global epidemic of **obesity and unhealthy habits**:  
- More than **70% of the adult population in Mexico** is overweight or obese (INEGI, 2021).  
- Chronic diseases related to poor diet (such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer) continue to rise.  
- The food industry often lacks sustainability, generating waste, high carbon emissions, and limited support for local farmers.  

These issues are **preventable** through healthier eating, consistent physical activity, and reducing food waste.

- Offering daily reminders to encourage healthy and consistent habits.  
- Connecting users directly with **local farmers** to purchase fresh products, supporting local economies and reducing environmental impact.  
- Creating a **supportive community**, where users can share progress and motivate each other.
